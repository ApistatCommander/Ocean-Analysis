### Abstract

We are concerned with plastic in the ocean because the state of our oceans are just as important as any other system on earth. To address this concern we plan to investigate where this ocean plastic is coming from, how effective are countermeasures against plastic waste, and how prevalent are micro plastics.

**Keywords:** ocean; waste; pollution; plastic.

## Introduction

71% of the world is water and oceans contain 92% of that water. Thus it is vital to understand what is happening in that water. Just like understanding and fighting pollution in our atmosphere is important, understanding what is happening in our hydrosphere (the ocean) is just as important. We often don't think about our trash after we throw it away. Out of sight, out of mind. However, a lot of trash ends up in the ocean. With stories of micro plastics being found in the bellies of fish, this is not a reality we can ignore any longer. With being in Seattle and having the puget sound just a couple blocks away, how much of these micro plastics are ending up in our backyard? Sure, recycling is one way we try to reduce plastic waste, but how effective is that with keeping plastic out of the ocean? If we want our oceans to not become a dump yard, then we need to understand where this plastic is coming from.

## Problem Domain
#### Framing the Problem Domain

Our world is full of plastic. We depend on plastic for nearly everything. Yet do we know what happens to that plastic after we throw it away? According to IUCN, “at least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Plastic debris is currently the most abundant type of litter in the ocean, making up 80% of all marine debris found from surface water to deep-sea sediments.” Our oceans are becoming full of plastic. How is this happening? Countries like the US and the UK export their trash to countries with less strict labor and dumping laws. Even though those laws are less strict, trash often gets dumped or disposed of illegally. That leads to a high likelihood of that plastic trash ending up in the ocean.

#### Stakeholders

These developed countries that ship their trash away would rather do that then pay more to have it properly dealt with in their own country. These countries that import this trash are often negatively affected by this. It can damage the aesthetics of that country, driving away tourism. Pollution from this waste can negatively affect the citizens that live near these dump sites. People who work at the trash dump sites are often exploited due to the loose labor laws that are often in these countries.

#### Human Values

One solution that we came up with was recycling. Do recycling measures actually work? Well according to the BBC, “The Philippines has just shipped back tonnes of rubbish to Canada that it said was falsely labeled as plastic recycling in 2013 and 2014.” Recycling has been instilled in all of us as our part of fighting pollution and being good to the environment. But what’s the good of us recycling if our own country is not going to do the same? Another solution was picking up trash at the beach. Who doesn’t want their neighborhood beach to look nice and clean. Sure, it's good to pick up trash at the beach, but who is going to pick up trash on the beaches of the countries that dump their trash on the beach or the countries that have huge amounts of trash washed up on their beach.

Living in America, we often don’t think about where our trash goes after throwing it away. Out of sight, out of mind. Most people are probably unaware that our trash gets shipped off to other countries to be dealt with. This line of thinking often allows people to be careless and litter which often ends up in the ocean. According to IUCN, “the main sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based, coming from urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste disposal and management”. This ocean waste often negatively affects ocean ecosystems, “the most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion, suffocation, and entanglement of hundreds of marine species.”

#### Benefits and Harms

Despite being harmful to the countries’ environment and residents, importing waste from other countries does bring economic benefits for them. If countries stopped exporting their waste, then the countries that import it will probably be negatively affected economically. The countries that export waste might not also be prepared to deal with all this new waste and the citizens of that country might become negatively affected. Also, because our whole world has been built on the use of plastics, a new shift into a plastic free life might economically harm a lot of people across the globe. Plastic free products and a plastic free lifestyle is often more expensive than one filled with plastic use.

We must find solutions for cleaning the plastic pollutants in the ocean as well as prevent it entirely. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, "Studies estimate there are now 15-51 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans." This is dangerous for the well-being of the marine animals, humans, and the planet. Finding solutions and creating policies that will save the earth are necessary for our survival.

## Research questions

1. Where does the majority of the plastic in the ocean end up?
    * The plastic that ends up in the ocean has to go somewhere. If that somewhere is a land mass then a community that lives near it. It is important to understand how that community is affected because they deserve to live in a clean and safe environment just like us.


2. What types of microplastics are prevalent? How is that affecting the human body?
    * Microplastics are becoming a part of our everyday lives and we don’t know the effects on our bodies they might cause. Thus it is important for us to understand how and where it is happening, what type of microplastics are the most prevalent, and how that is affecting us.


3. What are common waste items that end up on beaches and shorelines?
    * Shorelines, beaches, and coastal areas are where animals and humans spend a lot of their time. As these areas become more and more polluted it creates greater harm for the people and creatures that frequent these areas. Animals that come to shore can become harmed through ingesting waste. People can become injured by stepping on waste or ingesting waste from the fish they catch or buy from fishermen who fish near coastal areas. It is important to know what are common waste items so that policies can be enforced that regulate these items.


4. What top ten countries emit the most plastic waste?
    * It is important to understand which country emits the most plastic waste into the ocean so that solution efforts can be made in those countries and policymakers in those countries can enact change and these places can get environmental justice.


5. What animals are affected by marine plastic?
    * As more plastics are ending up in the oceans, this will inevitably end up affecting the lives of many organisms that live there as plastic eventually ends up inside them. The effects of plastics on one species can affect the entire ecosystem. Additionally, many people depend on the ocean, so pollution will also affect the lives of people globally. Therefore, knowing which animals are affected can help urge policymakers to enact change, which will help protect the ecosystem and ensure the safety and well-being of the people.


## The Dataset

1. Tracking Marine Litter with a Global Ocean Model: Where Does it Go? Where does it Come From?
    * This dataset tracks where the trash goes from each country and where it ends up. It also records how much goes into the ocean and how much goes onto a beach. It will help answer the question of where our trash/plastic ends up. This data was collected/formulated by Eric Chassinget, Xiaobiao Xu, Olmo Zavala-Romero in order to analyze where ocean trash goes. They did this in 2021. This project was funded by the United Nations Environment Program.


2. Microplastic and Microparticle Data From Surface Water: San Francisco Bay and Adjacent Sanctuaries
    * This data was collected by the San Francisco Estuary Institute and it was collected in order to better understand microplastic and microparticle pollution in the San Francisco Bay and nearby areas. This data was collected from 2014-2018. This was funded by The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Because this data is being presented by the state of California, I believe that it is trustworthy. By using San Francisco as a case study, this dataset will help us understand how microplastics are concentrated in our coastal cities.


3. Most common items found during the International Coastal Ocean Cleanup in 2020
    * This data relates to the problem domain and the research question because it shows what type of ocean waste and plastic ends up on beaches, coastal areas, and shorelines. This data was collected by the Ocean Conservancy in 2021. The purpose of this data is to show what was collected on international beaches and coastal areas to inspire a lasting commitment to keep oceans clean. The data was collected by the Ocean Conservancy that hosts an International Coastal Cleanup movement where volunteers gather around the world to clean up beaches and coastal areas. The trash that is collected is sorted and counted by the Ocean Conservancy’s partners. This data is credible because it comes from an organization that works toward cleaning the ocean and conservation efforts. This data answers the research question.


  4. Plastic Pollution - Plastic Emitted to Ocean per Capita
      * This data relates to the problem domain and the research question because it shows data of sources of countries that emit the most plastic into the oceans. This data was collected by Meijer et al. (2021) sourced from: “More than 1000 rivers account for 80% of global riverine plastic emissions into the ocean.” Science Advances. The data was collected to show where many of the plastic emissions in the ocean come from.

5. Plastic Ingestion by Marine Fish
    * This data relates to the problem domain and the research question because it shows data regarding who is affected by the plastic within the ocean: marine life. Furthermore, since we depend on marine life, the data is also relevant to many countries and its inhabitants. The data was collected by Matthew S. Savoca, Alexandra G. McInturf, and Elliot L. Hazen in 2021. The study was conducted in order to see plastic consumption within different species, which would then indicate which species and region would need to be further studied.

## Expected Implications:

* The expected implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers is to implement waste management solutions that will ultimately reduce waste and ocean pollution. We hope to bring awareness about this issue to policymakers and influence them to pass policies that will reduce single use plastic and bring recycling and waste management to educational institutions. Policies could be made to support less wasteful methods of consumption for everyday consumers and encourage more sustainable options. If the world is better educated about the consequences and damages of ocean plastic it would create a greater need for solutions to prevent the decline of health of the environment, animals, and humans. It could also inspire people to make a greater effort in removing microplastics from the ocean or water nearby cities.
* Another expected implication is to influence technologists and designers to engineer better recycling and waste management technologies to reduce single use plastics. We hope that engineers, technologists, and designers will create designs that will clean the ocean of all pollutants, from microplastics to large industrial waste; with this waste it can be recycled or managed so that it takes up less space and no longer harms the environment. Removing microplastics from the ocean will create a new lifestyle that is less reliant on plastic. Once we remove microplastics from the environment, we need to find ways to eliminate future plastics from polluting the ocean. Currently, many necessities are created from plastics. As a result, this may encourage development of eco-friendly alternatives to plastics. By developing alternatives, we need to make sure that they are sustainable and practical in order to not hinder people's quality of life. In this way, we can one day reduce and eliminate the dependence of plastics and, as a result, the amount of microplastics in the environment. If these policies, recycle and waste machines, and ocean cleaning technologies were created then there will be environmental justice for the oceans, animals, people, and the world.

## Limitations

Some limitations is in the way that some of the data is collected because there maybe some uncertainty as result of the methods that are used for collected. For example, for some datasets there is little observational data, so a numerical model and simulation is used to track plastics instead. Further uncertainties can be a result of anomalies in the environment such as the currents in the ocean. Furthermore, some datasets have greater focuses on certain regions than other regions. Therefore, this can mean that some regions may not be accounted for, and, in turn, some populations may be excluded as well. Likewise, since the ocean is so vast, some parts of the ocean cannot be accounted for. This can mean that some creatures, such as those deep in the deep-sea, may not be able to be accounted for due to being unstudied.

## Findings
#### Research Question 1
The first research question asks “Where does the majority of the plastic in the ocean end up and if that is near a land mass, how does that affect the community living there?” From our analysis we found that the countries that release the most trash in the ocean and onto beaches are China, Philippines, and India. All three of them also release more trash onto beaches than into the ocean: China (84.2% on the beach, 15.8% in the ocean), India (63.5% on the beach, 36.5% in the ocean), Philippines (64.2% on the beach, 35.8% in the ocean).

#### Research Question 2
The second research question asks “What types of microplastics are prevalent? How is that affecting the human body?” Out of all the locations the data was collected (blankwater, effluent, runoff, sample water, sediment, tissue), the top three types of microplastics were fiber, fragment, and foam. Despite the limited available knowledge on the effect that microplastics have on the human body, “increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, immune disorders and cancers may also be related to the increased exposure to environmental contaminants, including microplastics” (Prata). We can use the analysis done on the San Francisco bay as a case study to further speculate on the microplastic concentrations in other coastal areas.

#### Research Question 3
The findings for the third research question: “What are common waste items on beaches and shorelines?” We found that the most common items collected during the International Coastal Ocean Cleanup in 2020 were cigarette butts, with 27% of all the items collected. The least common item found was glass beverage bottles, with 4% of all collected items.

#### Research Question 4
The fourth research question is, “What top ten countries emit the most and least plastic waste?” From our data analysis, we found that the top ten countries that emit the most plastic waste to the ocean per capita in kilograms per year are (in descending order): the Philippines (3.296 kg/y), Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, Malaysia, Guyana, Panama, Grenada, Belize, and Jamaica (0.792 kg/yr). The countries that emit the least (excluding countries with zero emissions) plastic waste to the ocean per capita per kilograms per year (in ascending order) are Saudi Arabia (0.000088 kg/yr), Jordan, Somalia, Oman, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Namibia, Bulgaria, and Australia (0.0013 kg/yr).

#### Research Question 5
The fifth research question, “Which animals are affected by marine plastic?” From our data analysis, we found that the species of fish with the most particles of plastic was the Asian sea bass. It contained 1,268.5 particles of plastic on average. The whale shark had the second highest amount of particles of 38. Furthermore, when looking at the proportion of fish species that contained plastic, the data showed that every individual fish in the population contained species. Species include whale sharks, Japanese sea bass, and three-lined tongue sole. 

## Discussion

We must stress the importance of our findings because they are crucial in helping us understand where ocean plastics come from and what does that mean for us. Ocean plastics are negatively impacting the environment for several reasons. First and foremost, the presence of plastic in the ocean is harmful to marine life. Many marine animals, such as turtles, fish, and birds, mistake plastic for food and eat it. This can cause them to become sick or even die. In addition, plastic that breaks down into small particles, known as microplastics, can be ingested by marine life and enter the food chain, potentially harming the animals that consume them and eventually making their way into the human food supply. Another major concern with ocean plastics is that they can persist in the environment for hundreds of years, slowly breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces but never fully biodegrading. This means that the amount of plastic in the ocean is constantly increasing, and it is becoming more and more difficult to clean up. Furthermore, the presence of plastic in the ocean can have negative aesthetic and economic effects. The accumulation of plastic in certain areas can make them unsightly and potentially harmful to tourism and other industries that depend on the health of the ocean.
In conclusion, the presence of plastic in the ocean is harmful to marine life, can persist in the environment for hundreds of years, and can have negative aesthetic and economic effects. It is important for us to reduce our use of plastic and properly dispose of it to prevent it from entering the ocean and causing further harm to the environment.

If we understand where it comes from and how it affects the planet we can use this data to implicate new policies in our country and around the world. This data can also help implicate new technologies that will help with waste management, recycling, and cleaning of our environment on land and in the ocean, which will ultimately prevent littering and pollution. This data will help promote environmental justice towards our oceans, marine life, and ourselves as humans because microplastics can end up in human bodies through the food we eat. The implications of our findings will influence the general public and policymakers that ocean plastics and pollution is something that we must proactively prevent because it will harm the health of the planet, animals, and ourselves.


## Conclusion

As individuals, we won’t be on earth for long. We’re only on earth for an infinitely small amount of time when compared to the entire of earth. There have been 6 other mass extinction events before humans ever existed and there will probably be many more in the future. Thus, you might think what you do or what others do during our stay might not matter in the grand scheme of things. But it does. It does now. All the trash and microplastics in our ocean and beaches did not appear out of thin air. Humans put them there. Humans flicked their cigarette butts on beaches and let large amounts of trash flow onto beaches and into the ocean without a care in the world. Now, we are facing the consequences of actions like that. Microplastics are being found in seafood that we consume and we have barely scratched the surface of the health effects those microplastics have on the body. Beaches are becoming more like landfills than they are beaches. Finding trash in the ocean is becoming more common than finding fish. There are garbage patches in the ocean bigger than the size of Texas. These are the result of careless people and careless governments who would rather dump the problem into the ocean, or onto the beach or a less developed country than figure out a better solution.

What is the future for the next generation or the generation after that? If we don’t start making an effort for change then they will live in a world that is even more full of trash and plastic than ours. Someone has to put limits on the countries that mismanage their trash. Our government won’t do it on their own because they reap the benefits of exporting to those countries. We have to stand up and fight for this change otherwise it won’t happen. We need to make living a less wasteful lifestyle more accessible for all, not just it being a trend for elites. We need to start finding better ways to manage the trash we have already created. We need to care about the freshwater and saltwater ecosystems that are being affected by all this trash. We need to care about the future generations that are going to have to deal with the actions of the people that came before them. We need to advocate for change and environmental justice.
