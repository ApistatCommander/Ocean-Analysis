## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Summary Paragraph

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../source/summary_values.R")
fish_with_most_plastic_ind
highest_country_in_ocean
most_plastic_type
top_country
top_item
num_litter
```
From the fifth dataset, it showed that plastic poses a great threat to fish because the fish with most plastic per individual was `r fish_with_most_plastic_ind`.


## Table



## Chart One
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../source/chart_1.R")
chart
```

This chart serves the purpose of answering the third research question: "What are common waste items that end up on beaches and shorelines?" This chart shows the proportions of the most common items found on coastlines that were collected during the International Coastal Ocean Cleanup in 2020. There were 3,548,691 items collected. The most common item found was cigarette butts with a 27% of all the items collected. The least common item that was found was glass beverage bottles with a 4% of all the items collected.

## Chart Two
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("../source/chart_2.R")
chart
```

This chart serves the purpose of answering the fourth research question: "What top ten countries emit the most plastic waste?" This chart shows the top ten countries that emit the most plastic waste to the ocean per capita in kilograms per year. The country that emits the most waste per capita is the Philippines with over three kilograms (3.296 kg/yr) of mismanaged plastic waste to the ocean per year. The country that emits the least per capita (in the top ten) is Jamaica with less than one kilogram (0.792 kg/yr) of mismanaged plastic waste to the ocean per year.
