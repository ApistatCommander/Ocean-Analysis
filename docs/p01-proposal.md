**Abstract:**
We are concerned with plastic in the ocean because the state of our oceans are just as important as any other system on earth. To address this concern we plan to investigate where this ocean plastic is coming from, how effective are countermeasures against plastic waste, and how prevalent are micro plastics.


**Keywords:** ocean, waste, pollution, recycling


## **Introduction**
71% of the world is water and oceans contain 92% of that water. Thus it is vital to understand what is happening in that water. Just like understanding and fighting pollution in our atmosphere is important, understanding what is happening in our hydrosphere (the ocean) is just as important. We often don’t think about our trash after we throw it away. Out of sight, out of mind. However, a lot of trash ends up in the ocean. With stories of micro plastics being found in the bellies of fish, this is not a reality we can ignore any longer. With being in Seattle and having the puget sound just a couple blocks away, how much of these microplastics are ending up in our backyard? Sure, recycling is one way we try to reduce plastic waste, but how effective is that with keeping plastic out of the ocean? If we want our oceans to not become a dump yard, then we need to understand where this plastic is coming from.

## Problem Domain
Our world is full of plastic. We depend on plastic for nearly everything. Yet do we know what happens to that plastic after we throw it away? According to IUCN, “at least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Plastic debris is currently the most abundant type of litter in the ocean, making up 80% of all marine debris found from surface water to deep-sea sediments.” Our oceans are becoming full of plastic. How is this happening? Countries like the US and the UK export their trash to countries with less strict labor and dumping laws. Even though those laws are less strict, trash often gets dumped or disposed of illegally. That leads to a high likelihood of that plastic trash ending up in the ocean. These developed countries that ship their trash away would rather do that then pay more to have it properly dealt with in their own country. These countries that import this trash are often negatively affected by this. It can damage the aesthetics of that country, driving away tourism. Pollution from this waste can negatively affect the citizens that live near these dump sites. People who work at the trash dump sites are often exploited due to the loose labor laws that are often in these countries.

One solution that we came up with was recycling. Do recycling measures actually work? Well according to the BBC, “The Philippines has just shipped back tonnes of rubbish to Canada that it said was falsely labeled as plastic recycling in 2013 adn 2014.” Recycling has been instilled in all of us as our part of fighting pollution and being good to the environment. But what’s the good of us recycling if our own country is not going to do the same? Another solution was picking up trash at the beach. Who doesn’t want their neighborhood beach to look nice and clean. Sure, it's good to pick up trash at the beach, but who is going to pick up trash on the beaches of the countries that dump their trash on the beach or the countries that have huge amounts of trash washed up on their beach.

Living in America, we often don’t think about where our trash goes after throwing it away. Out of sight, out of mind. Most people are probably unaware that our trash gets shipped off to other countries to be dealt with. This line of thinking often allows people to be careless and litter which often ends up in the ocean. According to IUCN, “the main sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based, coming from urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste disposal and management”. This ocean waste often negatively affects ocean ecosystems, “the most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion, suffocation, and entanglement of hundreds of marine species.”

Despite being harmful to the countries’ environment and residents, importing waste from other countries does bring economic benefits for them. If countries stopped exporting their waste, then the countries that import it will probably be negatively affected economically. The countries that export waste might not also be prepared to deal with all this new waste and the citizens of that country might become negatively affected. Also, because our whole world has been built on the use of plastics, a new shift into a plastic free life might economically harm a lot of people across the globe. Plastic free products and a plastic free lifestyle is often more expensive than one filled with plastic use.

We must find solutions for cleaning the plastic pollutants in the ocean as well as prevent it entirely. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, "Studies estimate there are now 15-51 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans." This is dangerous for the well-being of the marine animals, humans, and the planet. Finding solutions and creating policies that will save the earth are necessary for our survival.


## Research Questions:
1. Where does the majority of the plastic in the ocean end up and if that is near a land mass, how does that affect the community living there?
  * The plastic that ends up in the ocean has to go somewhere. If that somewhere is a land mass then a community that lives near it. It is important to understand how that community is affected because they deserve to live in a clean and safe environment just like us.


2. How are microplastics becoming part of the ocean ecosystem? What types of microplastics are prevalent?
  * Microplastics are becoming a part of our everyday lives and we don’t know the effects on our bodies they might cause. Thus it is important for us to understand how and where it is happening and what type of microplastics are the most prevalent.


3. What are common waste items that end up on beaches and shorelines?
  * Shorelines, beaches, and coastal areas are where animals and humans spend a lot of their time. As these areas become more and more polluted it creates greater harm for the people and creatures that frequent these areas. Animals that come to shore can become harmed through ingesting waste. People can become injured by stepping on waste or ingesting waste from the fish they catch or buy from fishermen who fish near coastal areas. It is important to know what are common waste items so that policies can be enforced that regulate these items.


4. What countries emit the most plastic waste?
  * It is important to understand which country emits the most plastic waste into the ocean so that solution efforts can be made in those countries and policymakers in those countries can enact change and these places can get environmental justice.


5. What animals are affected by marine plastic?
  * As more plastics are ending up in the oceans, this will inevitably end up affecting the lives of many organisms that live there as plastic eventually ends up inside them. The effects of plastics on one species can affect the entire ecosystem. Additionally, many people depend on the ocean, so pollution will also affect the lives of people globally. Therefore, knowing which animals are affected can help urge policymakers to enact change, which will help protect the ecosystem and ensure the safety and well-being of the people.

## The Datasets:
1. Tracking Marine Litter with a Global Ocean Model: Where Does it Go? Where does it Come From?
  * This dataset tracks where the trash goes from each country and where it ends up. It also records how much goes into the ocean and how much goes onto a beach. It will help answer the question of where our trash/plastic ends up. This data was collected/formulated by Eric Chassinget, Xiaobiao Xu, Olmo Zavala-Romero in order to analyze where ocean trash goes. They did this in 2021. This project was funded by the United Nations Environment Program.


2. Microplastic and Microparticle Data From Surface Water: San Francisco Bay and Adjacent Sanctuaries
  * This data was collected by the San Francisco Estuary Institute and it was collected in order to better understand microplastic and microparticle pollution in the San Francisco Bay and nearby areas. This data was collected from 2014-2018. This was funded by The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Because this data is being presented by the state of California, I believe that it is trustworthy. By using San Francisco as a case study, this dataset will help us understand how microplastics are concentrated in our coastal cities.


3. Most common items found during the International Coastal Ocean Cleanup in 2020
  * This data relates to the problem domain and the research question because it shows what type of ocean waste and plastic ends up on beaches, coastal areas, and shorelines. This data was collected by the Ocean Conservancy in 2021. The purpose of this data is to show what was collected on international beaches and coastal areas to inspire a lasting commitment to keep oceans clean. The data was collected by the Ocean Conservancy that hosts an International Coastal Cleanup movement where volunteers gather around the world to clean up beaches and coastal areas. The trash that is collected is sorted and counted by the Ocean Conservancy’s partners. This data is credible because it comes from an organization that works toward cleaning the ocean and conservation efforts. This data answers the research question.


  4. Plastic Pollution - Plastic Emitted to Ocean per Capita
    * This data relates to the problem domain and the research question because it shows data of sources of countries that emit the most plastic into the oceans. This data was collected by Meijer et al. (2021) sourced from: “More than 1000 rivers account for 80% of global riverine plastic emissions into the ocean.” Science Advances. The data was collected to show where many of the plastic emissions in the ocean come from.

5. Plastic Ingestion by Marine Fish
  * This data relates to the problem domain and the research question because it shows data regarding who is affected by the plastic within the ocean: marine life. Furthermore, since we depend on marine life, the data is also relevant to many countries and its inhabitants. The data was collected by Matthew S. Savoca, Alexandra G. McInturf, and Elliot L. Hazen in 2021. The study was conducted in order to see plastic consumption within different species, which would then indicate which species and region would need to be further studied.

## Expected Implications:
The expected implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers is to implement waste management solutions that will ultimately reduce waste and ocean pollution. We hope to bring awareness about this issue to policymakers and influence them to pass policies that will reduce single use plastic and bring recycling and waste management to educational institutions. Policies could be made to support less wasteful methods of consumption for everyday consumers and encourage more sustainable options. If the world is better educated about the consequences and damages of ocean plastic it would create a greater need for solutions to prevent the decline of health of the environment, animals, and humans. It could also inspire people to make a greater effort in removing microplastics from the ocean or water nearby cities. We hope to influence technologists and designers to engineer better recycling and waste management technologies to reduce single use plastics. We hope that engineers, technologists, and designers will create designs that will clean the ocean of all pollutants, from microplastics to large industrial waste; with this waste it can be recycled or managed so that it takes up less space and no longer harms the environment. If these policies, recycle and waste machines, and ocean cleaning technologies were created then there will be environmental justice for the oceans, animals, people, and the world.

## Limitations
Some limitations we would need to address is how we can make these practices sustainable. Many of today’s goods and necessities are created with plastic. Furthermore, plastic is cheap to produce. Plastic plays an essential role in the lives of millions of people; almost everything we use is made of plastic. Therefore, we need to find a way to encourage the use of non plastics. If we can find alternatives to plastics, we need to make sure that they are cheap and affordable for people. How can we encourage people to abandon plastic in their lives? Additionally, we need to make sure that these alternatives do not also harm the planet as well. Not only do we need to think about the people who use plastics, but we also need to consider the companies that produce it. These companies produce billions of dollars off of the production of plastic. Therefore, we also would need to go against these companies, and this could have a global impact. We need to find a way to go after these companies. Creating a plastic-free ocean and ecosystem not only requires us to think about what we should do now, but how we can also maintain it in the future.
