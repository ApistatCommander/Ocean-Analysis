### Abstract

We are concerned with plastic in the ocean because the state of our oceans are just as important as any other system on earth. To address this concern we plan to investigate where this ocean plastic is coming from, how effective are countermeasures against plastic waste, and how prevalent are micro plastics.

**Keywords:** ocean; waste; pollution; plastic.

## Introduction

71% of the world is water and oceans contain 92% of that water. Thus it is vital to understand what is happening in that water. Just like understanding and fighting pollution in our atmosphere is important, understanding what is happening in our hydrosphere (the ocean) is just as important. We often don't think about our trash after we throw it away. Out of sight, out of mind. However, a lot of trash ends up in the ocean. With stories of micro plastics being found in the bellies of fish, this is not a reality we can ignore any longer. With being in Seattle and having the puget sound just a couple blocks away, how much of these micro plastics are ending up in our backyard? Sure, recycling is one way we try to reduce plastic waste, but how effective is that with keeping plastic out of the ocean? If we want our oceans to not become a dump yard, then we need to understand where this plastic is coming from.

## Problem Domain
#### Framing the Problem Domain

Our world is full of plastic. We depend on plastic for nearly everything. Yet do we know what happens to that plastic after we throw it away? According to IUCN, “at least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Plastic debris is currently the most abundant type of litter in the ocean, making up 80% of all marine debris found from surface water to deep-sea sediments.” Our oceans are becoming full of plastic. How is this happening? Countries like the US and the UK export their trash to countries with less strict labor and dumping laws. Even though those laws are less strict, trash often gets dumped or disposed of illegally. That leads to a high likelihood of that plastic trash ending up in the ocean.

#### Stakeholders

These developed countries that ship their trash away would rather do that then pay more to have it properly dealt with in their own country. These countries that import this trash are often negatively affected by this. It can damage the aesthetics of that country, driving away tourism. Pollution from this waste can negatively affect the citizens that live near these dump sites. People who work at the trash dump sites are often exploited due to the loose labor laws that are often in these countries.

#### Human Values

One solution that we came up with was recycling. Do recycling measures actually work? Well according to the BBC, “The Philippines has just shipped back tonnes of rubbish to Canada that it said was falsely labeled as plastic recycling in 2013 and 2014.” Recycling has been instilled in all of us as our part of fighting pollution and being good to the environment. But what’s the good of us recycling if our own country is not going to do the same? Another solution was picking up trash at the beach. Who doesn’t want their neighborhood beach to look nice and clean. Sure, it's good to pick up trash at the beach, but who is going to pick up trash on the beaches of the countries that dump their trash on the beach or the countries that have huge amounts of trash washed up on their beach.

Living in America, we often don’t think about where our trash goes after throwing it away. Out of sight, out of mind. Most people are probably unaware that our trash gets shipped off to other countries to be dealt with. This line of thinking often allows people to be careless and litter which often ends up in the ocean. According to IUCN, “the main sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based, coming from urban and stormwater runoff, sewer overflows, littering, inadequate waste disposal and management”. This ocean waste often negatively affects ocean ecosystems, “the most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion, suffocation, and entanglement of hundreds of marine species.”

#### Benefits and Harms

Despite being harmful to the countries’ environment and residents, importing waste from other countries does bring economic benefits for them. If countries stopped exporting their waste, then the countries that import it will probably be negatively affected economically. The countries that export waste might not also be prepared to deal with all this new waste and the citizens of that country might become negatively affected. Also, because our whole world has been built on the use of plastics, a new shift into a plastic free life might economically harm a lot of people across the globe. Plastic free products and a plastic free lifestyle is often more expensive than one filled with plastic use.

We must find solutions for cleaning the plastic pollutants in the ocean as well as prevent it entirely. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, "Studies estimate there are now 15-51 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans." This is dangerous for the well-being of the marine animals, humans, and the planet. Finding solutions and creating policies that will save the earth are necessary for our survival.
